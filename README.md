As the this repo is very limited in scope, those searching for any other plugin that may be following the fate of lost media may have luck in the following areas:
- https://www.openrce.org/downloads/browse/OllyDbg_Plugins
- https://forum.tuts4you.com/files/category/61-ollydbg/
- https://github.com/JackAston/OllyDbg1plugins (What this was forked from)
- Probably many other forums/obscure repos

In case you are unfamiliar with how to use these:
1. If open, close ollydbg
2. For whichever plugin you desire, copy a .dll from this repo into the folder where ollydbg is installed
3. open ollydbg, check the 'Plugins' item to sanity check the new plugin was recognized
